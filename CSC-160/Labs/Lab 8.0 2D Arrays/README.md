Magic Square

A Magic Square is a square filled with numbers so that the total of each row, each column and each main diagonal are all the same.

Write a program that will read multiple sets of 16 numbers from Lab8Data.txt (these numbers fill a 4x4 square) and determine if each set of 16 numbers is a magic square.

Use the sentinel method to control your loop. The sentinel value is -999

Lab8Data.txt sample data: (the actual file will contain more than two sets of 16 numbers)

1 2 3 4

5 6 7 8

9 10 11 12

13 14 15 16

1 15 14 4

12 6 7 9

8 10 11 5

13 3 2 16

-999

Sample run:

NOT a magic square

1 15 14 4

12 6 7 9

8 10 11 5

13 3 2 16

IS a magic square
